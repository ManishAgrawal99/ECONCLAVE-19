# ECONCLAVE-19
Website for the E-Cell event E-Conclave

The site was made by me to cover the E-Conclave event.
It was used to showcase the information about different events and personalities that were a part of E-Conclave.
It was also used to register for events using the Townscript API

The site can be found here:
